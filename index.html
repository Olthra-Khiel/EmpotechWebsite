                <h2>TYPHOID</h2>
                <p>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Typhoid fever is a life-threatening systemic infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, typically transmitted through contaminated food or water. It remains a critical global health concern due to its high contagion rate and the risk of severe complications, such as intestinal perforation, if left untreated. Those most at risk include children, travelers, and people living in areas with poor sanitation infrastructure. Fortunately, the disease is manageable through a combination of preventative vaccinations, improved WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) practices, and prompt treatment with antibiotics.

                <h2>CHOLERA</h2>
                <p>

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is a critical global health threat because of its ability to cause severe dehydration and death within hours if left untreated, acting as a key indicator of inequity and lack of social development. Those most at risk include people living in areas with inadequate sanitation and limited access to safe drinking water, particularly in humanitarian crisis zones or overcrowded settings. Fortunately, cholera is predictable and preventable through improved water and sanitation (WASH) practices and oral vaccines, while treatment remains highly effective through prompt administration of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) and, in severe cases, intravenous fluids and antibiotics.

                <h2>HISTORY</h2>
                <p>
Typhoid fever has been affecting humans for centuries, with evidence of typhoid-like illnesses recorded in ancient civilizations such as Rome, Greece, and Egypt. However, the disease became a major public health problem during the 19th and early 20th centuries, especially in rapidly urbanizing cities with poor sanitation, overcrowding, and contaminated water supplies. Outbreaks were common in Europe and North America, causing high mortality rates. The identification of the causative bacterium, Salmonella Typhi, by Karl Eberth in 1880, marked a significant milestone in understanding the disease. Following this, advancements in diagnostic techniques, antibiotics, and vaccination programs in the early 20th century greatly reduced typhoid mortality in developed countries. Despite this progress, typhoid remains a serious health concern in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in regions where access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare is limited. Globally, typhoid continues to infect millions of people annually, emphasizing the need for public health interventions and vaccination campaigns.

                <h2>CAUSES</h2>
                <p>
Typhoid is caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with the bacteria Salmonella typhi. This often happens due to poor hygiene practices, unsafe drinking water, and improper food handling. People who do not wash their hands properly after using the toilet can also spread the bacteria to others.
                </p>

                 <p>
Typhoid spreads through the fecal–oral route, meaning the bacteria pass from feces to mouth. This can occur when food or water is contaminated, or when proper handwashing is not practiced. Close contact with an infected person can also increase the risk of transmission.
                </p>

            </section>

            <section class="fade-in">
                <h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
                <p>
People with typhoid may experience high fever, headache, stomach pain, weakness, and loss of appetite. Some may have diarrhea or constipation. Symptoms usually appear gradually, which is why early detection is important to avoid complications.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="fade-in">
                <h2>REMEDIES</h2>
                <p>
Typhoid can be prevented by practicing proper hygiene and sanitation. Drinking clean and safe water, washing hands regularly, eating well-cooked food, and maintaining a clean environment are effective ways to reduce risk. Vaccination is also available and provides additional protection.
                </p>

                <p>
Typhoid fever can be treated using antibiotics prescribed by a doctor. Adequate rest, hydration, and proper nutrition are important during recovery. Seeking medical attention early helps prevent severe complications and speeds up healing.
                </p>

                <p>
Social media and online platforms help spread health awareness by sharing accurate information about typhoid prevention and symptoms. Educational posts, infographics, and online campaigns can encourage people to practice good hygiene and seek medical help when needed.

                <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>
Cholera, caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, has a well-documented history of recurrent pandemics over the past two centuries. The first recorded cholera pandemic began in 1817 in the Ganges Delta of India, spreading along trade routes to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and beyond. Since then, there have been seven major cholera pandemics, with the disease reaching Europe, Africa, and the Americas, causing widespread deaths. Cholera outbreaks were historically linked to contaminated water sources, poor sanitation, and population movements, which facilitated rapid transmission. The discovery of Vibrio cholerae by Robert Koch in 1884 enabled better understanding and control of the disease. Significant reductions in cholera mortality occurred in the 20th century due to improvements in clean water access, sewage treatment, hygiene education, and the development of oral rehydration therapy (ORT). Despite these advances, cholera remains endemic in many parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, particularly in areas affected by natural disasters, flooding, or inadequate sanitation infrastructure, highlighting the ongoing importance of prevention and rapid treatment.

                <h2>CAUSES</h2>
                <p>
Cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae, usually appears suddenly and primarily affects the intestines. Its main symptoms include sudden, profuse watery diarrhea (often called “rice-water stools”), vomiting, rapid dehydration, dry mouth, low blood pressure, and muscle cramps. Without prompt treatment, severe cholera can be life-threatening within hours due to dehydration.

            <section class="fade-in">
                <h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
                <p>
Spreads primarily through contaminated water or food, especially in areas with poor sanitation or during floods and overcrowding. Cholera mainly causes sudden, severe diarrhea and dehydration, which can be life-threatening if not treated quickly. Unlike typhoid, close contact with infected individuals is not a common mode of transmission.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="fade-in">
                <h2>REMEDIES</h2>
                <p>
Cholera treatment focuses primarily on rapid rehydration, either orally with oral rehydration salts (ORS) or intravenously in severe cases, to replace fluids and electrolytes lost through diarrhea. Antibiotics such as doxycycline or azithromycin may be given in severe infections to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms. Proper supportive care, including nutritional support, is essential for full recovery.
                </p>

                <p>
To prevent cholera, ensure access to safe drinking water and avoid water or ice of uncertain quality. Wash hands regularly, especially before eating or preparing food, and cook food thoroughly. Proper sanitation, including safe disposal of human waste, is essential to prevent the spread of cholera. During outbreaks, avoid eating raw or unwashed foods and seek immediate treatment if symptoms appear.

                <h2> ADDRESSING THE ISSUE </h2>
            <p>
In La Trinidad, Benguet, rivers and waterways are commonly used by children as places to swim, play, and socialize—especially during hot weather. However, many of these rivers are affected by improper waste disposal, with trash and wastewater flowing directly into them. This creates a serious risk for waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera, which spread through contaminated water and poor sanitation.

Children are particularly vulnerable because they may accidentally ingest contaminated water while swimming or fail to wash their hands properly afterward. Limited awareness about these diseases and their transmission increases the risk of infection. Addressing this issue requires community education, improved hygiene practices, responsible waste management, and the use of technology and social media to spread awareness and promote healthier behaviors.            </p>
